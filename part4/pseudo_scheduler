q1:dedup, radix
q2:canneal, black, vips
q3: freqmine, ferret

meaning of the queues : qi => jobs in there will prefer running on i cores and they have i threads

scheduling:

memcached runs on core 0 and if needs more (above a certain cpu utilization threshol, give it also core 1)

for the rest:
if 3 cores available:
	case q3 full => q3
	case q2,q1 both full => run one of each (q2 on 2 cores, q1 on 1 core)
	case q2 empty => run as many 1 as possible
	case q1 empty => run 2 q2 (with one on 1 core) if |q2|>1 else one q2 on all cores
	
if 2 availabe:
	case q2 full => run q2
	case |q1|>1 => 2 q1 
	case q3 full => q3 on 2 threads
	case => q1 on all threads
	
can run all => decision [3,1,1,0] [set 1, set 2, set 3] => for q in distr, start or unpause with given set et regarde next dans decision (si c'est different, alors pause tout ce qui suit dans ta queue)
